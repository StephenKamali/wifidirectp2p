Hopscotch - Group 6
--------------

This is an Android app using Wifi-Direct to send files through a P2P network of devices.

It is built with Android SDK 29 which supports Android 10.
To set up a true "network" you'll need 3 devices, but the wifi-direct capabilities can be seen with just 2 devices and the UI and file uploads can be demoed with just one device.

The .apk file we submitted is the executable version of the app.

The source code is included in the submission, but also viewable at https://github.com/StephenKamali/wifidirectp2p
